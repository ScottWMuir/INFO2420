	<h3><u> What was your first impression of this site?</u></h3>

		<p> My first impressions of the website would be that they are trying to make you hungry. Not only do they include recipes and food suggestions, but with these suggestions they include pictures that grab the reader’s attention and make you want to eat the food in the picture.</p>

	<h3><u>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</u></h3>

		<p>The organization of information is good in my opinion. They have links on the left side of the page that go to different types of pages. The links themselves are pictures which make the website look very professional.</p>
		
	<h3><u>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</u></h3>
	
		<p>The site structure makes sense to me because the part of the website I would like to explore is right on the first page, you don’t even have to scroll.</p>
		
	<h3><u>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</u></h3>
	
		<p>I think that the graphics and layout make the website look very professional and they have justified meanings.</p>
		
	<h3><u>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
	reasonable?</u></h3>
	
		<p>The load time was fast, not much to load</p>
		
	<h3><u>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</u></h3>
	
		<p>The important information was in bold and large, while less important information was smaller and not bold. Which made the first recipe that they are advertising really stand out so that it’s the first thing visitors of the website see.</p>
		
	<h3><u>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</u></h3>
	
		<p>Theres a navigation bar on the left side and it has picture links and names underneath which is professional.</p>
		
	<h3><u>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</u></h3>
	
		<p>Each page had the same layout with few color-changes</p>
		
	<h3><u>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</u></h3>
	
		<p>As I decrease the window the site seems to adapt well.</p>
		
	<h3><u>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</u></h3>
	
		<p>I really like how they made the links to the other pages, and I also think that the advertisement of their meatless meatballs on the front page was clever.</p>
